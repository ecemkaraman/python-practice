When player 1 connects it accepts input on that socket as a telnet connection with `telnet_keys()`.  Input from both players is forwarded to `game_machine()`.  When `game_machine()` asks for the timer to be reset this generator creates a `countdown_generator()` that will be used to give player 1 a countdown as their time is running out.\n",

The file descriptors passed will either be the console and server socket when player 1 is not connected, or the console and the client socket when player 1 is connected.  The timeout will be set if there is a countdown in progress.  `select.select()` yields a list of the file descriptors that are readable, or an empty list if the timeout was reached."
